Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, s, determine how many letters of the SOS message have been changed by radiation.

Example

s='SOSTOT'

The original message was SOSSOS. Two of the message's characters were changed in transit.

Function Description

Complete the marsExploration function in the editor below.

marsExploration has the following parameter(s):

string s: the string as received on Earth
Returns

int: the number of letters changed during transmission
Input Format

There is one line of input: a single string,s .

Explanation

Sample 0

S = SOSSPSSQSSOR,|S|=12 and signal length . Sami sent 4 SOS messages (i.e.:12 / 3 = 4).

Expected signal: SOSSOSSOSSOS
Recieved signal: SOSSPSSQSSOR

We print the number of changed letters, which is 3.

Sample 1

S = SOSSOT, and signal length |S| = 6. Sami sent  SOS messages (i.e.:6 / 3 = 2).

Expected Signal: SOSSOS
Received Signal: SOSSOT

We print the number of changed letters, which is 1.
